## dependencies

- `core-js` not needed unless including IE polyfills, See [13954](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13954#issuecomment-485822832)


## routing

### lazy load modules

Lazily load parts of your application using the router. This is accomplished by using the loadChildren key in your route configuration.

`{path: `/admin`, loadChildren: () => import(`./admin/admin.module`).then(m => m.AdminModule)}`

This will improve the support from editors like VSCode and WebStorm who will now be able to understand and validate these imports for you.

## cli

### web workers

[Web workers\(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) are a great way to speed up your application if you do any sort of cpu-intensive processing. Web workers allow you to offload work to a background thread, such as image or video manipulation. We use web workers on angular.io for in-app search indexing.

You can now generate new web workers from the CLI. To add a worker to your project, you can run:

`ng generate webWorker my-worker`

Once you have a web worker, you can use it normally in your application, and the CLI will be able to bundle and code split it correctly:

const worker = new Worker(`./my-worker.worker`, { type: `module` });`
