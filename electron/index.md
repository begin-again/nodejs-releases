# Electron Releases

Beginning in September 2021 with Electron 15, the Electron team will temporarily support the latest four stable major versions. This extended support is intended to help Electron developers transition to the new eight week release cadence, and will continue until May 2022, with the release of Electron 19. At that time, the Electron team will drop support back to the latest three stable major versions.

The latest three stable major versions are supported by the Electron team. For example, if the latest release is 6.1.x, then the 5.0.x as well as the 4.2.x series are supported. We only support the latest minor release for each stable release series. This means that in the case of a security fix 6.1.x will receive the fix, but we will not release a new version of 6.0.x.
